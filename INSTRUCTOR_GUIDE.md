# Instructor Guide (not shown to students)

## 1. Push this repo to GitHub

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial exercise template"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-org-or-username>/python1-exercises.git
git push -u origin main
```

## 2. Mark it as a Template Repository

On the repo's GitHub page: **Settings -> General -> Template repository**
(check the box).

## 3. Create a GitHub Classroom assignment

1. Go to https://classroom.github.com and create/select your classroom.
2. **New Assignment** -> "Individual assignment".
3. Under "Add a template repository," pick this repo.
4. Under "Add autograding tests" you can optionally set up autograding
   through Classroom's UI, OR just rely on the `.github/workflows/classroom.yml`
   workflow already included — it runs `python run_tests.py` on every push
   and shows up as a green/red check on each student's repo and in the
   Classroom roster.
5. Get the invite link and share it with students. Each student who clicks
   it gets their own private repo cloned from this template.

## 4. Tracking progress

- The Classroom "Assignments" page shows each student's repo, last commit
  time, and (if you set up autograding) a pass/fail score per exercise.
- You can also bulk-clone every student repo at once using the
  [GitHub Classroom CLI](https://github.com/github/gh-classroom) if you
  want to inspect code locally:

  ```bash
  gh classroom clone student-repos
  ```

## 5. Adding real exercises from the PowerPoint

Exercises are organized by lesson: `exercises/lesson_01/` through
`exercises/lesson_10/`, one folder per class session. Add a new lesson by
creating a `lesson_NN/` folder, then add one exercise folder inside it for
each exercise (classwork, homework, etc.):

```
exercises/lesson_02/exercise_01_loops_classwork/
    README.md          <- instructions for students
    exercise.py         <- starter code with TODOs, functions return None/pass
    test_exercise.py     <- test cases (pytest asserts)
```

To add exercises to an existing lesson, copy an existing exercise folder as
a template within that lesson's folder and rename it.

Naming convention:
- Lesson folders: `lesson_NN` (e.g. `lesson_02`) — `run_tests.py` formats
  this automatically into a readable label (e.g. "Lesson 02").
- Exercise folders: `exercise_NN_short_description` (e.g.
  `exercise_01_loops_classwork`) — formatted into a label like
  "Exercise 01 - Loops Classwork".
